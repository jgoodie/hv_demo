# Unstructured Data Summarization and Intelligent Search
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This demo shows how organizations can utilize intelligent data retrieval methods such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to improve customer satisfaction and reduce support costs while enabling employes to be more efficient when search for specific information.

This demo utilizes the following technology from:

* OpenAI to create text embeddings, audio/video transcription, and large language model (LLM) support
* Deeplake to store the vector embeddings and enable similary or semantic search
* LangChain to allow developers to create applications powered by large language models.


This shows how orgizations can implement multi-modal search to enable them to gain insights not just from textual data, but from audio, video, image, and other unstructured data formats.
